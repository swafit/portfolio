		<h1>School</h1>
		<p>I went to St-Johns School and obtained my diploma. I am currently in my first year of college at Champlain St-Lambert in the 3 year Computer Science program. I chose this program since I really like computers and want to work with them in the future.  My classes are educational so far and I enjoy being in Computer Science since computers have always been my strength and I know they are not going away in the future.</p>
