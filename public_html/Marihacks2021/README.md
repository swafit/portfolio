# Automated Notifications System

Our website was meant to solve the Automated Notification System for Meetings problem. In which the admin needs to manually adds the names and emails of the users to the javascript array. Furthermore, the admin can enter the subject and body of the email and send customized to all users. This allows the admin to send emails to users in bulk.
